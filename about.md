![Chris Nicola][1]

Hi, my name is Chris Nicola and I'm a software developer/engineer/architect or
whatever flavour-of-the-month title is floating around these days. Simply put I
create software. I've have a B.Sc(Eng) and M.Sc in applied math with computing
and communications (they had a three-for-one special on engineering degrees
that year). This blog is primarily about my learnings and (mis)adventures in
software development. I've discussed languages, frameworks, patterns and
practices, tools, etc. I've also blogged quite a bit about agile software
development and more recently I've been upgrading that thinking with the ideas
from lean and The [Lean Startup][3]. On the side, I also enjoy cooking, brewing
beer, drinking beer, and photography so I may occasionally break from the
regularly schedule programming to post up new sets of photos or a new recipe
that's worked out particularly well. You can also follow me on twitter
[@lucisferre][4] and on [Google+][5].
