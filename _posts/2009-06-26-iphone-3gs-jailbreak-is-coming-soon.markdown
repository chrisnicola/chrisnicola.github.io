[http://blog.iphone-dev.org/][1] The "[Dev Team][1]", the _shady group of techies_ who have made a hobby out of cracking whatever Apple comes out with to protect the iPhone, have announced they have discovered the hardware exploit needed to create a working jailbreak app for the 3GS phones.  

I should say re-discovered as apparently it is the same exploit that works for the iPod Touch 2G. Anyways there still isn't anything available to jailbreak the phone yet, but it should be _very soon._ I took a quick look at their "[notes][2]" reminds me a little bit of the assembler code from the Motorola chips we used to play with in EE labs.  I couldn't tell you what the hell it means though, but iirc CMP - compare, ADD - addition, SUB - subtract, but those are kinda obvious.
