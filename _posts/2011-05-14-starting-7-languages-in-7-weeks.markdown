![btlang_xlargecover][1]

So I went down to Chapters (yes I still like to actually walk into book stores)
to go find [Rest In Practice][3], but instead came out with [7 Languages in 7 Weeks][2].  
This has two very useful purposes for me.  One I feel that learning a bit about
a lot of different languages helps teach perspective when solving programming
problems in any language.  Second, that means, assuming I stick to the
schedule, that I will have 1 blog post on a new language for each of the next 7
weeks.

<!--more-->

7L7W covers **Ruby** (which I know a bit of), **Io**, **Prolog**, **Scala**,
**Erlang**, **Clojure** and **Haskell**.  What I love about the authors choice
of languages is that these are all fairly unusual choices, though not
completely obscure, and would be unlikely to be encountered in your typical,
workin-for-a-livin software development. 

For each language I'm going to do a little movie review of the language,
summarizing it, laying out what aspects I like about the language, anything I
didn't like and why I think it's cool (or perhaps why I think it's not so
cool).  I also want to talk a bit about what each language teaches me about
programming at a higher level that can be applied more broadly.

I know it's been quiet around here so hopefully a little "light" reading will
help me break out of this rut.
