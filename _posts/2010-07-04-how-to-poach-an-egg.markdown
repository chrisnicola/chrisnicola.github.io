![poached][1]

Today I finally managed to make poached eggs properly.  Sadly, while I am generally a pretty good cook, poaching an egg without it falling apart in the pot of water always seemed to elude me, I could never quite get it perfect.  Today I found out why.

Apparently, the water must not actually be boiling, it should be a low simmer at the most.  The violent movement of the water was what was thwarting me, poached eggs need calm seas. I feel like a bit of an idiot for not realizing this earlier.

Finally, one of the simplest cooking techniques (outside of making toast perhaps) is mine!

(And no, unfortunately that picture isn’t one of mine, I didn’t think to take a photo, CC search ftw!)
