Well it's almost Fall in Vancouver, and that means both TechDays and the [Agile Vancouver][1]: Much Ado about Agile conferences are coming up.  Last year unfortunately I missed TechDays, but I am fortunate this year to have the opportunity to go to both.

I will actually be speaking at TechDays in the "Local Flavors" track, which consists of speakers from here in Vancouver.  I'll be giving a talk on CQRS and how to leverage the pattern to achieve greater reversibility in software designs.

I recently received the draft program for Agile Vancouver and once again it has an amazing line-up of speakers.  I don't want to spill the beans before they post it though so I'll post a link as soon as I know it's official.  I can say that there will be an Open Spaces portion on the Friday that will be faciliated by [Adam Dymitruk][2], [Robert Reppel][3] and myself. 

I am excited to be involved in both Agile Vancouver and TechDays.  I highly recommend attending both of them, they are great opportunities to learn and discuss and on the topic of discussions, there is a good chance that there will be one or two 'extra-curricular' (think #altnetbeers) events happening.  So be sure to keep an eye out for announcements either here or at [ALT.NET Vancouver][4].

Time to get back to preparing slides.
