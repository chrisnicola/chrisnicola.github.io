I am excited about the [ALT.NET Seattle][1] conference coming up soon.  I really learned a lot at the last two ALT.NET Vancouver events after DevTeach and the Agile Vancouver conference.  I've been told the Seattle event is even better (hard to be better if it not in Vancouver imo, but we will see). 

If anyone reading this is thinking of going make sure to use [this link][2] to sign up, a google search for alt.net seattle will likely take you to an old event page which will say the event is sold out (not sure why they haven't taking it down yet).  On that note, does anyone know of any good places to stay near the Microsoft campus?
