If you have not heard of TekPub yet, I recommend you give it a whirl.  [TekPub][1] is a site with video learning for various software development technologies.  Topics include MVC, nHibernate, Git, JQuery, Rails and more. The videos are a great way to get started but they are also fairly in depth.  Most series contain 8 or more videos so they are very good for taking your first deep dive into a particular technology. TekPub also gives back by [sponsoring various user groups][2], now including [ALT.NET Vancouver][3].  They will be providing us with one-day subscription coupons which we will start to give away at monthly meet-ups and events.  So on behalf of everyone who is a part of ALT.NET Vancouver I want to thank TekPub.
