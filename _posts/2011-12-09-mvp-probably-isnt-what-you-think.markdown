Just over a year ago I had first heard of lean startup and about the idea of
starting new projects with the 'minimal viable product' a term that on it's
face value seems so clear and concise I, and many others I was working with,
assumed we understood what it meant.

Obviously, MVP just means the minimum amount of functionality that we can sell
to customers, hence creating a "minimal viable product" right? Wrong.

Unfortunately I've discovered even Eric sometimes slips up and uses a
definition of MVP that sounds a lot like this. In [this interview][1] he says

> The minimum viable product is that product which has just those features and
> no more that allows you to ship a product that early adopters see and, at
> least some of whom resonate with, pay you money for, and start to gave you
> feedback on. --- Eric Ries

Except that isn't exactly it, is it Eric?

Having recently actually read [Lean Startup][2] something I should have done a
long time ago obviously. It's clear now that MVP describes a process and an
approach to product develop and not the characteristics of what makes a product
"minimally viable". An MVP doesn't even really have to be a product and in many
of Eric's own examples it's certainly not viable (in that it could never bring
in anywhere near enough revenue to sustain the business or future product
development on it's own). An MVP is actually just an experiment. Nivi makes
this exact point in the very same [interview][1] and Eric agrees with him.

Eric has many examples of these types of MVP experiments from Dropbox' [Video MVP][3] 
to Food on the Table's [Concierge MVP][4]. Even creating a landing page
the explains your product using adwords to test how the incoming traffic
responds to the idea is considered an MVP, but I can't think of a single person
who would consider that a product.

Perhaps a clearer term than MVP could be something like 'minimal viability
test' since what we are attempting to do is invest a minimal amount of effort
in something that will provide us with a measurable result that can help
determine the viability of our product ideas. Unfortunately, MVP is in the
hearts and minds of businesses and developers now so I think in some respects
it's too late for a new name. The best we can do is try to educate people about
what is really meant by MVP and go back to simple and obvious terms like
"version 1" for when we are talking about the actual release of a viable
product, since quite a lot of time time this is what people mean when they say
MVP.
