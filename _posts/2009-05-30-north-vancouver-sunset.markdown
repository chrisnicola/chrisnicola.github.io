A Picture I took on Sam's balcony in North Vancouver. I retouched it a bit, increased the shadows a lot, brought up the highlights and saturation very slightly. Just small changes in Google Picasa. I actually like Google Picasa for retouching because it limits the adjustments and changes I can make. If I was editing in Photoshop I'd probably be tweaking it for hours.
