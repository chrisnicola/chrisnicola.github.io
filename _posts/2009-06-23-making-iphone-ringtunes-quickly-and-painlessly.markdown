Some of you may have noticed you can't use iTunes to make ringtunes from songs that you didn't purchase through iTunes. Well you are in luck, [this little article][1] has _extremely _easy to follow instructions on how to make custom ringtunes from _any_ of your songs (itunes DRM or not) using only iTunes.  It really couldn't be easier (well obviously it could be, iTunes could just let you make the ringtunes directly).

Honestly, I will never get Apple's attitude towards its customers.  If it is going to be this easy anyways why prevent people from right-clicking on any song and making it a ringtune? Sometimes it seems like Apple's mission statement is: "rip off the lazy and stupid".
