Well, I've moved my blog again and for what I hope will be the last time. 

Long story short, after numerous and repeated problems with
Webhost4Life--possibly the most incompetent and unreliable hosting provider
I've ever used--I've decided to go back to my old Linux hosting company and
switch to Wordpress.  

<!--more-->

Another reason for the move was to switch to Wordpress.  As cool as I thought
it would be to be able to hack on the code for my blog I really never ended up
doing much (though I did submit a couple bug fixes and improvements to the spam
filtering).  BlogEngine.NET is still, in my opinion, the best .NET blogging
platform right now, but still, it's no Wordpress. 

So with that said, please bear with me while a set up a new theme and attempt
to _manually_ migrate some of the images.  I _sincerely _hope this is the very
last time I ever have to do this, but just in case I think I will start hosting
images and files somewhere other the blog itself so that the links will
continue to work if I ever have to move again. 

Now that I'm back and running at full speed again, what's next? Well I've been
playing with a bunch of new things: Node.js, Rails, _lots _of CQRS stuff like
event sourcing, etc. so I have a bit of a backlog (some of it is already
written) which I will be publishing over the next few weeks a bit at a time.  I
fully intend to get my posting back up to at least one a week again.
