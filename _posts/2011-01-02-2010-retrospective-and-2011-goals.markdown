Last year, following the lead of other blogging developers I posted a
retrospective of my last year and committed to goals for the next.  It worked
out quite well and this year I will do it again.  I’m going to review some of
my major commitments (some of them changed throughout the year) and see how
well I did. 

It has been a pretty eventful year.  For starters I made two career
moves in one year.  My wife and I also persevered through a _very_ prolonged
(and costly) kitchen renovation.  We enjoyed an eye opening trip to Africa. 
However most notably, my wife and I also found out we are having a baby.  I
would probably be happy if next year was a little less eventful, but I very
much doubt it.

## Retrospective

Goal: Read Domain Driven Design – F Honestly I completely failed here, worst
goal ever.  I mean I read bits and pieces for reference fairly regularly, but I
have still not taken the time to sit down and get it all read, or at least all
the important bits.  For this year I plan to change this instead of committing
to specific books, since my interests shift often, I will instead commit to
reading more often, and taking notes and recording what I’ve been reading, even
blogging about it.  This way instead of failing to read one book, I will be
able to look back and review what I did end up reading. 

Goal: Contribute to an open source project – B I did manage to make one, albeit
small, contribution to the nCQRS project, the NoDB file based event store and a
couple of small bug fixes.  I plan to continue to increase my contributions to
open source this year by setting aside dedicated time to this commitment. 

Goal: Practice TDD and start learning/using BDD – A I have been steadily,
though slowly, improving my TDD skills in .NET.  I’ve also been using BDD style
test writing in my DDD/CQRS work.  I’ve recently started using MSpec as my BDD
framework of choice in .NET. 

Goal: Organize discussions/talks for the ALT.NET group – B Since starting up
the ALT.NET beers we have been meeting more regularly (almost every month).  It
would be nice to get some more learning/teaching oriented meetings going though
and that is the plan for this year.  iQmetrix has kindly offered up a space for
us to organize regular ‘hacker meetings’ when we can hack on code and drink
some beers. 

Goal: Submit at least one presentation/talk to a conference – A+ Aside from
submitting and being accepted to TechDays for my CQRS talk, Adam and Robert and
I also organized a small open-spaces session at Agile Vancouver (unfortunately
it was originally going to be a full day, but got cut down to a single session,
still it was very successful).  Also due to illness on Adam’s part I got to
join Stephan Moser doing a half-day workshop on DDD/CQRS also at Agile
Vancouver.  All in all a very successful result. 

Goal: Learn Ruby on Rails – B I really am only just beginning my journey into
Ruby, but RoR is just so comfortable to work with.  You can see a small example
of what I’ve been learning on Heroku where I have a [work-in-progress pomodoro
app][1] running there.  Rails is one of the most exciting things I’ve started
learning since getting into software development, and you can better believe I
will be continuing my learning here this year. 

Goal: Learn to use a powerful text editor – A I’ve absolutely fallen in love
with Vim.  I use Vim for RoR development, I use Viemu in Visual Studio and I’ve
installed Vimperator in firefox.  Modal navigation/editing is supreme! 

## Goals for 2011

Last year some of my goals proved a bit difficult to measure quantitatively. 
This year I am trying to set some goals that can be measured more easily. 

  * Learn TDD/BDD in Ruby by adding test coverage to pomodoro application
  * Read the 7 languages in 7 weeks book
  * Put aside at least 8 hours a month to contributing to open source and/or personal projects
  * Keep a notes/log of my reading and write a blog review of 1 book a quarter
  * Go to the gym (software development is making me sedentary) at least once a week, bonus points for twice a week

Finally there is blogging.  Davy Brion already [told everyone not to resolve to blog more][2], 
but I have a tendency not to do what people tell me.  This year
my blogging dropped to about half the previous year.  Procrastination was a big
reason, the other reason was indecisiveness about what to write.  So I won’t
resolve specifically to blog more I resolve to procrastinate less and be more
decisive.  As [Ayende][3] often says “just blog”. In the interest of keeping
myself accountable, I plan to get back up to ~50 posts this year, and I’ll know
deep down if I’m procrastinating again.
