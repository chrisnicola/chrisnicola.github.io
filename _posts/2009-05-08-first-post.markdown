Ok this is getting kind of clich√©. Every time I create a new blog (rarely) I do one of these posts and call it "first post".  I am hoping this blog is finally a bit more permanent. I went and got some hosting space months ago and just didn't get around to using it till now.

I have a ton of stuff I want to get up here now though, so expect the posts to be frequent for a while. I have been doing some software design in C# and Visual Studio (among other things) for the past year or so and I have found other programmer's blogs invaluable in the process of learning. I felt it was time I contributed to that community. I also will put in some generic blogging in Vancouver type posts (in general...) some stuff on politics and other argumentative bull (polemics) and I am going to put together a photoblog for some of my photos.

I generally find it hard to come up with names for things. Once I have one, even if I am not totally sold on it I usually stick with it and use it over and over again. For example, my gaming pseudonym: Seipher/seiph3r, which came from FFVIII but it really isn't because I thought Seipher was an awesome character, I just liked the name and the spelling. I used to go by lucif3r in some FPS games, and that is to some degree what got stuck in my head when I was picking a domain name for the site. _Lucis_ (light) and _ferre_ (to carry or bring) and yes these Latin origins of the name Lucifer (bringer of light). As I understand it, loosely, the word light in this sense actually implies knowledge or enlightenment. Though I digress, I am not going to get into a lot of religious analysis here, but the literal interpretation of the words makes you think, hopefully the name will prove to be apt (in the literal sense of course, there will be no Satan worshiping going on around here...)

Anyways, the site name is lucisferre.org (.com was taken ([what the hell is this?][1]) and while some may find the name odd or offensive, it's mine now and I'm sticking with it. Now I just hope that this site will live up to its meaning.
