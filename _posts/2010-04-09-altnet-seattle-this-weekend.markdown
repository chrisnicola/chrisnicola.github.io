Just getting ready to head off to ALT.NET Seattle after work today.  Looking forward to the open-spaces events (and the bar-related events as well).  I am hoping that during some of the downtime I will have time to finish some of the blogs entries I've been planning including:

  * Working with SVN (only if I have too!) using git 
  * Psake part 2: continuous integration with Teamcity
  * An update to my TreeView problem and a solution in code (though not an elegant one, I don't believe there is an elegant solution without writing a brand new VSP)

Hope to see some of you at alt.net.
