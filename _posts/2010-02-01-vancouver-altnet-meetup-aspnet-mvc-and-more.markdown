I probably should have posted this earlier, but there will be a meetup 6PM Feb 4th at the Library Square Pub downtown.  You can go [here to RSVP and for details][1].  It should be interesting.  Here is a short list of some potential topics for discussion:

  * ASP.NET MVC 
    * Why MVC is better than WebForms 
    * Using s#arp architecture as scaffolding for rapid application development 
  * Silverlight web development (thanks to Justin Angel) 
    * MVVM patterns 
    * Composite application guidance (PRISM) 
    * Silverlight and MVC together? 
  * JQuery 
    * Role of JQuery in client-side functionality in ASP.NET MVC 
    * corMVC (a jquery only client-side MVC framework) 

The meetup will start around 6pm.  There is parking available nearby at the libraryâ€™s underground parking lot.  Everyone is welcome, spread the word.
