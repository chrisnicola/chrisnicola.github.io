I've recently found myself in a bit of conflict over how I feel about
[this post][501developer] outlining a 501 developer manifesto, aimed at
those who choose to avoid making work run their life by stopping their
professional life at 501 sharp. The term isn't new, it's been used by [Scott Hanselman][sh] 
to describe developers who's enthusiasm turns off at 5:01pm. In this case the
author of the manifesto is saying we should all be ok with people who want to 
turn off and do other things after 5:01.

I can only assume the manifesto was written as a kind of response to [this recent article][sandberg] 
about Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg who goes home every day at
5:30.  Sandbergs admissions have become a bit of a rallying cry for the
overworked masses in tech and we certainly have our reasons to rally around
this.

The 501 manifest is actually a sentiment I can largly sympathize with. I'm a
big opponent of overtime, and I vehemently oppose laws that allow for overtime
exempt IT work, which exist in various states and provinces, specifically
both California and B.C. have these ridiculous laws.

However there are a number of things about the 501 developer manifesto I
specifically take issue with, which boil down to what Scott was talking about,
that we shouldn't have to turn off our enthusiasm for what we do just because
it's time to go home.

<!--more-->

From the manifesto:

> If you:
>
> * Write a technical blog
> * Contribute to open source projects
> * Attend user groups in your spare time
> * Mostly only read books about coding and productivity
> * Push to GitHub while sitting on the toilet
> * Are committed to maximum awesomeness at all times, or would have us believe it, 
>
> ...we respect you for it. There's probably some pity in there too, but honestly, it's mostly respect.

For starters I find this to be both condescending and divisive. I don't see
what any of this has to do with being a 501 developer. In fact, I find this
tone of this reeks of envy for those who can't help but enjoy the work,
whatever the feeling is it's certainly not pity.

I think this quote from a HN comment sums up the problem with the manifesto's argument
pretty succinctly.

> I decided I'm not spending over 25% of my life (37.5%) doing something I don't LOVE

All I can say, is that I strongly suggest that if you really haven't found that
passion of yours then use at least some of the time after 501 to go out and
find it, whatever you do please don't waste it deriding those who have found it.

It's fair to say that not everyone will discover a passion that is, well,
financially sustaining. So work is probably not going to be everyone's passion.
And everyone should be able to mutually respect that reality. Some peole work
to live and some live to work, and that's that. What I think we all should
agree on is that everyone should be able to hold reasonable "office hours".

This seems to be the overshadowed premise of what being a 501 developer should
be about. None of us should need be spending more than 40 hours a week doing any
one thing, love or not. In fact not only should it not be necessary but I'm
completely convinced it is a counterproductive exercise and a symptom of poor
time management, either personally or organizationally.

So, the time outside those 40 hours *is* yours, and we should feel free to use
them wisely. Personally, for me that time includes open source, user groups,
learning more about my craft and blogging (when I'm not busy procrastinating).
It also includes playing with my daughter, dinner with my wife, cooking,
brewing beer, gardening and even the occasional video game.

Here's the kicker, one for all those "what about the family people".
Surprisingly, even with all that to do I still somehow find an inordinate
amount time to watch some absolutely terrible TV shows. So I'm certain I will
always be able to find hours worth of wasted time to cut before I need cut into
extra-curricular time I spend focused on developing my passion for software
development.

So as a result of all this thinking, I've decided to take a stand and have
written my own 5:01 manifesto (or 5:30 or whatever time works for you). I made
it more inclusive, because it's not just about software developers, and tried to
focus on what I feel should be universally important no matter what..

## The 501 manifesto

We are individuals who take pride in our work, but value a process that
encourages our continuous self improvement for both the betterment of ourselves
and our craft. As such we value:

**Pace** over deadlines  
**Quality** over quantity  
**Sustainability** over death marching  
**Learning** over constantly plowing ahead with what we already know (or think we know)  

To say that we value the things on the left more than those on the right is a
gross understatement. Rather, we've come to see that the things on the right
are the enemies of those on the left. Overtime and burnout are the sworn
enemies of productivity, improvement and efficiency and most importantly the
enjoyment of our passion.

40 odd hours a week, 8 hours a day, is arguably the more time than anyone can
be effective working towards one goal, one task or purpose. We leverage the of
the rest of our time in order to better ourselves, to broaden our thinking and
maintain personal balance. In doing so we maximize our effectiveness during the
other 40 hours.

We do not accept that there is any significant value gained by plodding
needlessly into overtime. Overtime is a crutch and an excuse that leads to death
marches, poor time management and planning. It is also the enemy of our passion,
burning us out on the very things we love to do. We recognize that Attempting to
produce for 60 or 80 hours in a week results in a quality over quantity trade
off which is unacceptable.

We see the higher value in maintaining a sustainable pace in whatever we do. We
recognize that a more diversified time management portfolio yields greater long
term dividends through both personal and professional growth. That this results
in a better overall result for both us and the quality of our work.
