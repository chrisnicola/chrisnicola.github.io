If I have been quiet lately it is because I have been in back-to-back conferences of Devteach and ALT.NET Canada since last Monday. What spare time I had I used for sleeping, eating and trying to keep up on work. 

The sessions were outstanding and it was also a valuable opportunity to finally meet other people in my industry. I have left with a better understanding of concepts I was just starting to grasp, a mile long list of websites and books to read up on and more confidence in what I am doing. 

I will try to condense some of what I have been learning into some new posts over the next few days in the hopes that it is useful both for myself and maybe others. Thanks to everyone who organized and spoke at both conferences!
