[Cliff Hammerschmidt][1] who runs the VanDev meetup group let me know that he
gets a couple extra groups on Meetup with a single account so was kind enough
to set #altnetvan up [with our own][2]. So far it's been quite a success with a
number of new members finding us quickly on Meetup. The next two meetings have
already been posted so signup if you can make it out. They are a presentation
and the first part of a series of videos by Greg Young on CQRS and of course
the monthly ALT.NET Beers meetup, which was a huge success last month (thanks
[Thoughtworks ][3]for coming out last time).
