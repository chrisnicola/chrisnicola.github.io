[http://www.devteach.com/Index.aspx][1]

So I just found out about DevTeach this week thanks to [Ayende][2], which is both good and bad.  Good, because I found out in time to register for what looks like an amazing event that will cover a lot of topics I am just starting to grasp like Inversion of Control and ORM.  Bad, because I found out way too late for the early-bird discounts :-(.  I did manage to find a $100 discount code though by googling for them so it wasn't all bad.

I plan to spend a lot of time in the Agile track sessions but there are some other sessions I will likely try to attend.  I am torn between learning how to develop for the iPhone in .NET and attending Oren Eini's session on advanced IoC. I will be attending the pre-conference workshop on [Agile, IoC and ORM][3] which Oren is co-presenting so perhaps I can use that as an excuse to satisfy my selfish desire to learn how to code for the iPhone (I don't even own one...).

Right after DevTeach there is a free conference  for Alt.NET ([http://altnetconfcanada.com/home/index.castle][4]) I think there is still a lot of space to register and it is is **free**!

I expect it to be a busy week.
